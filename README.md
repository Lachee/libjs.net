# LibJS.NET

LibJS.NET is a .NET Binding for the [Ladybird](https://github.com/LadybirdBrowser/ladybird) LibJS engine.

It uses the minimal required code to get LibJS building and running, so it is missing some features of the Ladybird engine.

This is a **experimental** _library_. It is done as its own seperate repo as I feel that it is out of scope for Ladybird to support this weird edge case of embedding LibJS into .NET applications (or Unity games).

The changes I have made to Ladybird itself are done in patches. While they are small changes, I felt they are not nessarily high quality or appropriate to be commited back to the main Ladybird repository. 

## Deps
- clang-cl
- vcpkg
- python3
- cmake & ninja
- dotnet

## Building
> [!NOTE]  
> Building is done from the root project directory.

1. initialize the project `initialize.bat`
2. build the project `build.bat`
3. profit?

### Platform Support
This build was configured and made to work on Windows ðŸŽ‰ 
Linux support will be updated soon, but since Ladybird already supports building linux shared libraries, it wasn't a major priority. Simply build LB and add the .so to the root of the binding directory.
